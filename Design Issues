Right now I am storing entire file in my merkel tree
because of which this app will use RAM as much as sachin uses
straight drive.

So the issue is while init I am  creating merkel tree for all
the files which also has byte chunks ie entire file in it

When Download request comes it is querying the tree to get the chunk
so even if after init we change content of file, merkel tree check would not
be able to detect that as we are touching actual file only at init

Ideally merkel tree should only hold the metadata ( Ideally we don't even need to
store the entire merkel tree we just want the root, but lets do that once everything is working )

=============================================================================================

So Simple solution is to not storing chunks in merkel tree and reading it directly from file

============================================================================================

So faced one more issue that I was getting chunk hash from the tree, I have to getHash from chunk
got from file itself, because after init and tree is created and a chunk is tampered we would need to
get new updated hash so as to get empty validity hashes from tree for this invalid chunk
